# Analysis

Loading data:

```{r load data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
training<- read.csv("C:/Users/Sukhvir/Downloads/PML/pml-training.csv")
testing<- read.csv("C:/Users/Sukhvir/Downloads/PML/pml-testing.csv")
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval= FALSE}
# First look at the data
head(training)
head(testing)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval= FALSE}
# str data
str(training)
str(testing)
```


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval= FALSE}
# summary
summary(training)
summary(testing)
```

## Cross Validation

Cross-validation will be performed by spliting the training dataset into:

1) A training dataset, containing 70% of the observations. The models for prediction will be built using this dataset.

2) A testing dataset, containing 30% of the observations. The accuracy of our prediction models will be evaluated using this dataset.

```{r cross-validation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# load packages
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
# Index for training dataset (70%) and testing dataset (30%) 
# from the pml-training data set
set.seed(12345)
inTrain = createDataPartition(y=training$classe,p=0.7, list=FALSE)
# training dataset
training.set = training[inTrain,]
# testing dataset
testing.set = training[-inTrain,]
```

## Training and Testing


Training and testing data consist of 160 variables. The choice of specific predictors is based on removing near zero variance predictors, with the nearZeroVar function, and also variables containing many NAs.

```{r clean data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Remove near zero variance predictors
ind.nzv = nearZeroVar(x = training, saveMetrics = T)
# Remove variables with more than 50% NA values
ind.NA = !as.logical(apply(training, 2, function(x){ mean(is.na(x)) >= 0.5}))
# Cleaning data
ind2 = ind.NA*1 + (!ind.nzv$nzv)*1
ind3 = ind2 == 2
sum(ind3)
#View(data.frame(ind.NA, !ind.nzv$nzv, ind2, ind3))
training.set = training.set[,ind3]
testing.set = testing.set[, ind3]
training.set = training.set[, -1]
testing.set = testing.set[, -1]
testing = testing[,ind3]
testing = testing[,-1]
# Coerce the data into the same type in order to avoid
# "Matching Error" when calling random forest model, due to different levels in variables
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
  for(j in 1:length(training.set)) {
    if( length( grep(names(training.set[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) == 1)  {
      class(testing[j]) <- class(training.set[i])
    }      
  }      
}
# To get the same class between testing and training.set
testing = testing[,-ncol(testing)]
testing <- rbind(training.set[2, -58] , testing)
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

## Prediction Model

We will use two approaches to create a prediction model for the values of classe variable. 

Firstly prediction with trees will be attempted, using the 'rpart' method and the caret package.

```{r prediction with trees, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Prediction with Trees
# Build model
set.seed(12345)
tree.fit = train(y = training.set$classe,
                 x = training.set[,-ncol(training.set)],
                 method = "rpart")
# Plot classification tree
rattle::fancyRpartPlot(
  tree.fit$finalModel
)
# Predictions with rpart model
pred.tree = predict(tree.fit, testing.set[,-ncol(testing.set)])
# Get results (Accuracy, etc.)
confusionMatrix(pred.tree, testing.set$classe)
```

## Second Prediction

Secondly a prediction model using random forest method will be created.

```{r random forest, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Prediction with Random Forest
# Build model
set.seed(12345)
rf.fit = randomForest(
  classe ~ .,
  data = training.set,
  ntree = 250)
# Plot the Random Forests model
plot(rf.fit)
# Predict with random forest model
pred2 = predict(
  rf.fit,
  testing.set[,-ncol(testing.set)]
)
# Get results (Accuracy, etc.)
confusionMatrix(pred2, testing.set$classe)
```

The accuracy of the random forest model is, as expected, much higher than the rpart model, over 0.99!

Random Forest model performed better and constitutes the model of choice for predicting the 20 observations of the original pml-testing.csv dataset.

```{r pml-testing predictions, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Get predictions for the 20 observations of the original pml-testing.csv
pred.validation = predict(rf.fit, testing)
pred.validation
```

```{r saving results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Saving predictions for testing dataset
testing$pred.classe = pred.validation
write.table(
  testing,
  file = "testing_with_predictions",
  quote = F
)
```
